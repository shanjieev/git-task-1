difference between http 1.1 vs http2.0 
I'm mention http1.1 & all http2 before text's because can understand the comparison.
http 1.1 HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, 
http1.1The client (browser) has to send a request to the server using the method (GET/POST).
http1.1Server responds with the requested resource, for example – image, alongside the status of what it did to the client’s request.
http1.1.domain sharding/concatenation/minification/image sprites
http1.1.The http1.1 result taking much time compare to http2.0 
http1.1.Like (480 images running timing completed in max 6,008 ms )
http1.1. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it
HTTP/2  is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
http2.compress http headers
http2.The HTTP/2 protocol allows you to send multiple requests and responses when connected to a web server
http2.allows server push
http2.enabel multiplexing
http2.The http2.0 result taking very less time compare to http1.1
http2.Like (480 images running timing completed in max 797 ms )
http2.Binary protocols consume less bandwidth, are more efficiently parsed and are less error-prone
http2.HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer
